# struct `Play`

```
struct Play {
    playID UInt32
    metadata {String: String}
}
```

 Play is a Struct that holds metadata associated
 with a specific NBA play, like the legendary moment when
 Ray Allen hit the 3 to tie the Heat and Spurs in the 2013 finals game 6
 or when Lance Stephenson blew in the ear of Lebron James.

 Moment NFTs will all reference a single play as the owner of
 its metadata. The plays are publicly accessible, so anyone can
 read the metadata associated with a specific play ID
